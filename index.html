            <p>When trying to make simple changes to the files in your repo, such as attempting 
                to fix a typo in your README.md you might be tempted to make this change directly 
                via Github. However, it is best to avoid this as it will cause issues that require
                 more advanced Git knowledge than we want to go over at this stage (it is covered 
                 in a future lesson), for now it is advised to make any changes via your local files
                  then commit and push them using Git commands in your terminal once ready.

        <p>This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (
            You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize 
            yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:</p>
